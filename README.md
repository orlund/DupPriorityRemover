# DupPriorityRemover
Removes duplicates based on a priority.

Someone explained an excel problem that sounded like a challenge/learning opportunity for python code. 

The problem was there was a excel file of thousands of records of employees
A few thousand of them were duplicates
The duplicates had to be removed but with a priority of employment statuses of:
- Full Time over Part Time
- Part Time over Casual
So that in the end, each employee would have only one record

I did not have the data and it contained personal data
A script was used to create the data random data
- data was to have some people with 1 employement status, some with 2 and some with three
- Added other data in the data such as names, dates, an titles to provide a better example
- outputed the data before and after it was randomized for testing
- output is sorted and has a extra column for the prioritization of the employment status (this column could be removed)
